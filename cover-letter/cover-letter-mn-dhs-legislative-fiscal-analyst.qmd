I am writing to express my interest in the Legislative Fiscal Analysis Lead position (Job ID: 83939) with the Minnesota Department of Human Services. My experience in program evaluation, data-driven research, and collaborative leadership across the human services sector has prepared me to make significant contributions to the Aging and Disability Services Administration.

At the Minnesota Department of Human Services (2016-2023), I designed and maintained the Self-Support Index for the Minnesota Family Investment Program, developing predictive models of county performance. I merged administrative datasets, performed advanced statistical analysis, and communicated findings to program leadership, county officials, and legislative staff. While my roles have not centered on fiscal analysis, I provided data to colleagues for estimating fiscal impacts of MFIP program changes, including the switch to six month reporting and sanction reform.

As a Program Evaluator at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, I have strengthened my expertise in designing sophisticated program evaluations and research studies, including a causal analysis on the effect of remote work designations on federal hiring outcomes.

My qualifications align well with this position's requirements:

-   Strong statistical methods expertise from my mathematics background and professional experience

-   Proven success leading cross-divisional projects with diverse partners

-   Experience developing and leading technical training programs, including R for data science

-   Deep understanding of Minnesota's public assistance programs and evaluation frameworks

-   Proficiency with data analysis tools (R, SQL, GitHub) and complex statistical modeling

I am excited about applying my analytical skills and program knowledge to help the Aging and Disability Services Administration effectively manage Medical Assistance long-term services and support programs. I am eager to expand my expertise in fiscal analysis while contributing to policy decisions that improve Minnesotans' well-being.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with your needs.
