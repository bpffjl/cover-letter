I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Researcher position focused on Administrative Data Linking at Chapin Hall. With over a decade of experience analyzing administrative data to inform policy decisions, I believe my background aligns perfectly with Chapin Hall's mission.

My qualifications directly match your requirements:

-   Education: Bachelor's in Mathematics and Master's in International Affairs, exceeding the minimum requirement of a master's degree plus five years of experience

-   10+ years of direct experience managing and analyzing large administrative datasets

-   Extensive experience developing statistical models, including predictive modeling and causal analysis using matching methods

-   Strong programming skills in R, SQL, GitHub, and Azure DevOps

-   Expertise in data visualization using Tableau and Shiny

-   Proven track record of managing complex data projects across multiple organizations

At the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, I design and implement rigorous quantitative evaluations using administrative data. I developed and conducted a causal analysis using statistical matching to evaluate [how remote work designations affect applicant interest and hiring outcomes in Federal jobs](https://www.opm.gov/about-us/reports-publications/agency-reports/brief-on-the-effect-of-the-remote-work-designation-on-hiring/). I also lead the evaluation unit's transition to advanced data analysis tools including R and GitHub.

At the Minnesota Department of Human Services, I developed and maintained the [Self-Support Index](https://mn.gov/dhs/partners-and-providers/news-initiatives-reports-workgroups/economic-supports-cash-food/), a statewide performance measure that required extracting and merging multiple administrative datasets and developing predictive models. I collaborated with the Minneapolis Federal Reserve on their [minimum wage study](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/topic/minimum-wage). As Minnesota's representative to the [TANF Data Collaborative](https://www.mdrc.org/sites/default/files/img/pilotprofile_mn_jan2023.pdf), I worked closely with Chapin Hall and other partners to increase data analysis capacity across state and county governments. I was also an active member of Minnesota's [Early Childhood Longitudinal Data System (ECLDS)](https://eclds.mn.gov/), working to integrate data across state agencies.

At the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/) (J-PAL), I coordinated complex research initiatives between academic researchers, government policymakers, and practitioners. As Senior Research and Training Manager, I managed partnerships between research teams, government agencies, and implementing organizations, ensuring effective communication of research findings and facilitating the translation of academic research into actionable policy recommendations.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my skills and experience could contribute to Chapin Hall's important work improving outcomes for children, youth, and families.
